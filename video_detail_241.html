    <div class="video_desc">

    01:30 -- What's the best way to increase the level of difficulty in a video game?
04:02 -- What are Adam's most nostalgia-inducing games?
09:11 -- There are so many game remakes/reboots/sequels coming out (Strider, Thief, etc). Will this trend continue?
13:14 -- Is Star Citizen a true remake of Wing Commander? Or more of a "spiritual successor?"
14:37 -- What emerging industry trends worry you as a REVIEWER and as a GAMER?
15:50 -- Day one multiplayer server problems worry me
19:24 -- What is the "idea" of video games that Adam loves so much?
22:25 -- Nostalgic games revisited (LAN parties and huge XBOX controllers!)
25:50 -- How much of an allegiance should developers have with fans of an original series when creating a reboot?
29:38 -- If Fallout 3 was made for original Fallout fans it wouldn't have been as successful
30:15  - Mech Warrior Online was very different from the original BattleTech tabletop. Chaos ensues...
32:42 -- How do you best approach criticism from the gaming community?
35:42 -- Games that are so silly you just have to love them! (Adam likes Too Human?)
38:05 -- Game names are getting too serious! (Adam rants about Destiny...)
39:46 -- There are all these old games for Xbox, Playstation 2, and Gamecube that are currently unplayable. Why won't they take our money for them?
41:38 -- Super Mario Galaxy 2 is one of the most gorgeous games ever. Why can't I play it in 1080p HD?
43:08 -- If Adam was in charge of Nintendo, what would he do to save the company?
44:54 -- The attach rate of the original Wii was incredibly low. Was it just a fad?
48:41 -- More sillyness!
50:45 -- More nostalgia! (Pokemon Red & Blue, Handhelds, Super Mario Bros...)
52:24 -- Thoughts on videogame crossovers
53:50 -- The craziness that is Namco High...

This week on Address the Sess, we discuss a wide variety of topics - how great old Wii games would look in HD, AAA self-seriousness, the abundance of terrible video game titles, and a whole lot more. Join in!
